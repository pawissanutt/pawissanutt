### Hi, I’m Pawissanutt aka Wis.
- 🎓 Hi there! I'm a Computer Science and Engineering PhD at the University of North Texas, expecting to graduate in December 2025.
- ☁️ My main passion is solving complex challenges in cloud and serverless computing, with a focus on designing and optimizing scalable distributed systems.
- 💻 Before diving deep into research, I spent several years as a Software Engineer at ByteArk, where I developed software for content delivery networks (CDN) and video streaming.
- 🛠️ I'm proficient in languages like Java, Rust, and Python, and have hands-on experience with tools such as Kubernetes, Knative, Docker, and Kafka.

### My Key Projects & Publications

#### **Object-as-a-Service (OaaS)**

A novel serverless paradigm that encapsulates business logic, data, and requirements into a unified **object abstraction**, streamlining cloud-native development.
