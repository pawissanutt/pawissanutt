### Hi, I’m Pawissanutt aka Wis.
- 🎓 Hi there! I'm a Computer Science and Engineering PhD at the University of North Texas, expecting to graduate in December 2025.
- ☁️ My main passion is solving complex challenges in cloud and serverless computing, with a focus on designing and optimizing scalable distributed systems.
- 💻 Before diving deep into research, I spent several years as a Software Engineer at ByteArk, where I developed software for content delivery networks (CDN) and video streaming.
- 🛠️ I'm proficient in languages like Java, Rust, and Python, and have hands-on experience with tools such as Kubernetes, Knative, Docker, and Kafka.

### My Key Projects & Publications

I am the lead researcher on the [**Object-as-a-Service (OaaS)**](https://github.com/hpcclab/OaaS), a novel, serverless paradigm that streamlines cloud-native development by encapsulating business logic, data, and requirements into a single object abstraction.
* **Publication:** [Object as a Service (OaaS): Enabling object abstraction in serverless clouds](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10254994) (IEEE CLOUD 2023\)  
* **Publication:** [Object as a Service: Simplifying Cloud-Native Development through Serverless Object Abstraction](https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2025.3623602) (IEEE Transactions on Computers 2025\)

I am also a contributor to [**OaaS-IoT**](https://github.com/hpcclab/OaaS-IoT), a re-architecture of the OaaS paradigm specifically for edge-cloud applications. This extension manages function placement, service connectivity and data consistency to improve application responsiveness for IoT workloads.
