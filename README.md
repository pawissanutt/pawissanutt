### Hi, I’m Pawissanutt aka Wis.
🎓 **Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of North Texas** (Graduating December 2025)

☁️ I’m passionate about **cloud and serverless computing**, with a research focus on designing and optimizing **scalable distributed systems** that simplify development and improve performance.

💻 Before my Ph.D., I worked as a **Software Engineer at ByteArk**, developing software for **content delivery networks (CDNs)** and **video streaming platforms**.

🛠️ My technical toolkit includes **Java**, **Rust**, and **Python**, along with hands-on experience in **Kubernetes**, **Knative**, **Docker**, and **Kafka**.
